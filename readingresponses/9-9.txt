This reading is full of important ideas in information visualization. Much of the discussion is a centered on formalizing our intuitive notions of visualization. For example, Card et al. describe in detail the process of transforming raw data to a data table to visual structure (i.e., the reference model of visualization). Many of these steps, like the desire to transform raw data, are obvious, but their careful description provides us with a common language for talking about the creation of visualizations. One of the most important formalisms they introduce are Bertin's retinal properties. Before reading infovis literature, I didn't really think about the different marks that could be used to represent data; I thought, "Yeah, this is easy to understand," but I never realized that the choice of marks was crucial. If every visualization designer understood the relative benefits of position, size, orientation, color, texture, and shape, we'd have a much more pleasant time viewing visualizations.

The "Levels of Measurement" wikipedia page supplemented the discussion on Bertin's retinal properties, and further explored the different types of data-- nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. I count myself among the skeptics of performing nontrivial statistics on ordinal data. Medians and counts makes sense, but I am frustrated when researchers take means and standard deviations of ordinal data such as that from a Likert scale questionnaire. Regardless, combining retinal properties and levels of measurement give visualization designers a foundation to help make decisions during the design process.
