My fundamental problem with sense.us is that I don't think it's well motivated. The tools that they developed are nice, but it remains unclear why someone would go onto the site and play around with the visualizations. I suppose it functions well as "pure" visualization research-- that is, it's a good step forward for collaborative visualization software. Commentspace provides a similar system, but adds a set of tags that improve its relevance. Data analysts are the target audience, and they can use tags and links to organize their (scientific!) analysis process. While their target task is evidence-gathering, it would be cool to see some statistical tools incorporated in the system.

Scented Widgets tackles a problem with both sense.us and commentspace: how does a user discover popular visualizations that are related to his own interests and exploration? The scented widgets can help guide the viewer to commonly viewed visualizations. The application of scented widgets goes beyond collaborative visualization software, of course, but it's a nice example.
