This was a trio of interesting papers. The second paper stood out because of its grounding in prior work. Their banking algorithm was carefully designed with the complete history of 45 degree banking in mind. On the other hand, Cleveland's suggestions for dot charts were reminiscent of Tufte's suggestions in that they seemed to be appealing to our sensibilities rather than showing (or proving) that they are an effective visualization technique. The cartogram paper was similar, in that it proposed several design principles and guidelines without making an incredibly strong case for the technique. That being said, I like the cartogram technique because of the power to "shock" the viewer, as this reading mentioned. At the same time, it's difficult to judge areas of concave polygons (or any polygons in general). We'll learned previously that area is not good at encoding single variables, so it's sort of odd to see the cartogram technique romanticized in this way. So, while I think the technique has the power to "shock," and I enjoy looking at these maps, it's difficult for me to get anything out of them other than "these states/countries have high values and these have low values."
