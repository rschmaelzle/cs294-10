Chapter 10 of the Search User Interfaces book was a thorough overview of information visualizations that have been applied to search. Unfortunately, and frustratingly, none of these techniques seemed all that promising. In almost all of the cases, the chapter noted that the technique had serious problems, was not favored by users in studies, or was completely ignored in deployment. One problem with visualization for search user interfaces is that computers and the internet are fast enough that I personally don't see much of an opportunity cost in clicking on a bunch of links and skimming/CTRL-F'ing them for relevant data. I would not pay attention to the visualizations because the algorithms that generated those visualizations can't possibly understand exactly what I am searching for.

The second chapter was on visualization for text analysis. We've already covered several of these projects in class, so I'll focus on the Phrase Nets paper. This paper revitalized my waning interest for word-based visualizations. I never really thought word clouds could be that interesting, but this paper suggests that with just a little bit more structure and thought, word visualizations can be surprisingly revelatory. I still am not a huge fan of the arbitrary graph layout technique (stress/force-based) but the relationships shown in these are quite interesting. As future work, I would like to see someone apply a more nuanced layout approach to this sort of data.
