As I mentioned in the previous reading response, I really like the design-principle-to-algorithm methodology. The three papers for today's class all cover different aspects of that idea. The first paper, a survey of the basic idea, explicitly refers to design principles for visual communication. However, these ideas are not specific to the visual domain and can be applied to any problem where someone wants to automate design. For example, the second paper talks about pictorial and verbal depictions of routes. We could use the methodology from the first paper to automate the verbal depictions, as well, by studying the way people give directions. The final paper shows a method for automatically generating route maps. It does this in a nice way, preserving topology and eliding lengthy, repetitive segments of the route. A natural extension to this work (in light of the second paper) would be to generate verbal (or written) routes using the same principles. Sadly, the whole idea of giving directions and creating route maps is being made obsolete by the rise of GPS navigation devices. I'd be curious to know if such tools have a place in our current technological landscape. Mapkin (mapkin.co) seems to think so-- they've added personalized voices, details, and experiences to "make GPS fun."
