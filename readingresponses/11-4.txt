Today's readings were about graph layout. I've looked at a lot of work in this area before (mostly for my undergraduate thesis) and I really enjoy it. However, as my perspective on information visualization has broadened (thanks in no small part to this class), it's becoming clearer to me that one reason we haven't come up with the silver bullet of graph visualization techniques is that the research is largely unclear about the goals of different layout techniques. I liked "Hierarchical Edge Bundles" in part for this reason. The very first line of the abstract states that compound graphs are frequently encountered types of data sets, and it went on to talk about the problems with current visualization techniques. Ultimately, edge bundles allow the viewer to more easily see adjacency relationships at different hierarchical levels-- the results are quite beautiful, too, which can't hurt. But, in general, I was disappointed with the lack of justification behind many of the techniques in the survey paper.
