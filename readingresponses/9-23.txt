The three readings for today went well together; they each talked about perception in visualizations, but from different angles. The first was a survey that covered theories of pre- and post-attentive visual processing. The second described a series of experiments to discover how well people can estimate ratios with different visual encodings. The Tufte chapter was mostly about the phenomenon of accidentally creating visual artifacts (i.e., 1 + 1 = 3).

Each of these readings was interesting, but I'm looking for a Grand Unified Theory of perception for visualizations. How do I ensure that my graphic pre-attentively conveys as much as it can (Healey), allows for accurate reading (Cleveland/McGill) and only shows the data I intended to show (Tufte)? And how can I put all of this together automatically, a la APT? The design space of visualization is likely too big to solve this problem in a general sense, but it is an interesting question nonetheless.
