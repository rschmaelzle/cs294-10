There seems to be some disconnect with Tufte's stated goal for visualizations and the general use of visualizations. His chapter on high resolution data graphics notes that visualizations are better if they give the viewer an active role; that is, if they present the viewer with a large amount of data and allow him/her to draw their own conclusions. I accept this for some types of visualization, but in many cases, this is not the goal of a graphic. In many cases, graphics should serve to illustrate a point. That doesn't mean the graphic should lie to the viewer, but rather that it should be carefully constructed to show the most interesting or relevant data. Just because you can fit more data into a graphic doesn't mean that data will be useful (and it may prove very distracting).

I enjoyed the paper that described the low-level components of analytic activity in infovis. Its taxonomy will be useful for the second assignment. Even though this was presented as a potential method to evaluate infovis systems, it will also be useful to evaluate a single visualization-- that is, to see what types of questions a single vis can answer and how those fit in the taxonomy.
