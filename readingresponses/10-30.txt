Wes's papers are quite interesting (but let's be clear: they're about data analysis and not really about visualization). "Strategies" puts forth a clear set of rules for obtaining good results from crowdsourced analysis. I'm surprised it took until 2011 for someone to do this work, considering how much the research community discusses various tricks to get good results out of crowd workers. The techniques from this paper are more broadly applicable to many crowdsourcing tasks. The second paper is about giving analysts better tools to process the analysis that they collected with these crowdsourcing techniques. To complete an end-to-end system that these two papers hint at, we really ought to come up with a way to help analysts generate candidate charts. This is where visualization research can come into play. Otherwise, the analyst may be posting charts that do not show interesting parts of the data, rendering the rest of the pipeline useless. We can count on the analyst having domain expertise, but it would be ideal to provide him with some help in generating these charts.
