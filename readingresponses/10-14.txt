I was once again frustrated by Tufte's dogmatic writing. This time, the subject was color. My frustration came mostly with his discussion (or, really, lack of discussion) about the color-coded geometric proofs. I am not sure if these proofs are useful in general, and Tufte's writing provides me no help in deciding that. I am personally ok with "grappling" with alphabetic variable names, but I can understand how colors may be useful. I'm going to try to hunt down more information about these proofs (maybe some perceptual studies?).

I like Heer and Stone's paper on the color naming model. Its methodology is both its pro and its con, though. They got their hands on 3+ million data points that were obtained not by a controlled perceptual lab study, but by random visitors to a web site. So it's nice that they had a large amount of data and (presumably) a lot of external validity, but it's unclear about how their model might suffer because of the lack of control in generating the dataset. For example, the brightness of each monitor probably had a large impact on what each color looked like. I'd like to see a comparison of their color names saliency model to a color saliency model generated with several million data points from a lab study.
