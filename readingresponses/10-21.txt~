The three papers for today's class were all about layout. The cartography label layout paper was the most interesting to me because it was a fairly straightforward application of the design-principle-to-algorithm methodology that I like so much. I would have appreciated a bit more time spent on the principles themselves-- the authors talked about them as if they were common knowledge. Their algorithms, however, seemed well motivated by the principles. I wasn't blown away by their results, but I understand that they were trying to show a worst case scenario for map information density. The use of different hues and values for labels probably would have helped the visual presentation of the final maps. The second paper was a pleasant survey of automated layout techniques. I am very interested in this domain for things like document layout, but one problem in the domain that isn't addressed very thoroughly by the paper are how to evaluate layouts. They mentioned a few options, but I think that area of research should be explored more deeply.
