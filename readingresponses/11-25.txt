Of these three pieces of work on line drawings, I preferred the first- Automatic Illustration of 3D Geometric Models- at least in the context of a visualization class. It followed a well-motivated and easy-to-understand set of rules to render line drawings of objects that would portray occlusions and varying levels of importance. These techniques are very useful in the domain of visualization- that being, we want to show a drawing of the object that makes it easy to see certain features of said object. The other two papers were interesting, but less so in the context of visualization. In "Line Direction Matters," I would have liked to see a perceptual study showing that people could more easily understand the shape of an image when rendered with principal direction lines. Ultimately, this paper is optimizing some combination of perceptual quality and artistry (notice that there are random perturbations added to lines to make the results look more "artsy"). A pure visualization approach would focus more on generating as accurate a representation as possible. The final set of papers were about automatically drawing contour lines and "suggestive" contour lines. While I did not have time to get a deep understanding of their methodology, their results are impressive; I'd like to look into this more later.
