The survey on animation techniques was convincing to the extent that I'll be wary of including animation in a visualization if I don't have a very strong reason. I can't say I'm surprised with the findings that static displays are often preferable or no different to animated displays- I find it difficult to get my bearings with an animated visualization, and the speed is often too fast or too slow. Also: I can't believe this paper didn't show any images from the cited materials. The second paper builds a simple model of visualization "value." I have nothing against throwing some math at a problem, but as the author notes, this model is really just to let us think about how visualizations can work and not so much as a practical model. I think the author's points could have been made without the formalism of the model, which is ironic considering that he introduced the formalism more to "give a sense of quantification than as an exact and precise description." When did anyone ever build a formal mathematical model to _avoid_ precision? Maybe I'm missing something.
