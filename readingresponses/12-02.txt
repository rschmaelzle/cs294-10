These three papers on shading were all interesting- I don't have much of a background with these concepts so they were particularly revelatory. The first article discussed how our brains perceived shape from shading at very high level. I'd be curious to dig into some of the cited studies to see the details. I would also be interested to see how techniques like the image based relighting and lit spheres can be automatically inferred from input sources. I might have trouble applying those techniques without formal training or an artistic eye. By studying and applying design principles of paintings and lit compositions, we can give the novice user as much power as the seasoned artist.
