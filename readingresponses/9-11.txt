The second Tufte chapter was focused on data-ink and how to improve graphics. His main points, like showing the data, minimizing data-ink ratio, and so on, will lead to minimalist graphics. This is one way to create visualizations, but I'm not sure it's always the best way. In some cases, it might be important to be able to accurately (or at least semi-accurately) read off some data from the graphic. It may be easier to read this data if there are consistent gridlines. They can be very light, if necessary- Tufte doesn't really address that ink is not uniform in value. I'm hoping to come up with some other examples of non-minimalist visualizations that are successful; it's not that I think Tufte is horribly wrong, but rather that I don't think everything he says should be taken as gospel.

This first Tufte chapter was a rather depressing look at the reputation of statistics and graphics in the press and the general public. The first editition of this book was written over 30 years ago, so I would like to see if the reputation of statistics has improved with the rising popularity of interactive visualizations, and publications like the New York Times building up a dedicated graphics department.

Norman's chapter showed how information can be better understood if it's in a good representation. He comes to many of the same kind of conclusions as Tufte, but approaches things with a less dogmatic, more psychologically-driven voice. I like this chapter because it drives home the idea that the visual design (and all of the encodings, visual variables, etc.) is only as good as the representation. This is one hint that while a visualization may be beautiful and have a lovely minimalist design, it is only successful if it allows the viewer to find relevant information and to compute the desired conclusion.
